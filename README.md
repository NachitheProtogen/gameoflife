# Game of Life in Python!
I decided to code the game of life in a bunch of diffrent languages for fun!
## How you can run it
U need to have python3 installed on your PC otherwise you can just use this comand in your shell
```Shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NachitheProtogen/gameoflife/main/gameoflife.py | python3
```
